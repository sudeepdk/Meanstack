								<h4>The Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost refers both to a car model and to one specific car from that series.<h4>
								<br>
					<p  style="margin-top:25px">
						Originally named the "40/50 h.p." the chassis was first made at Royce's Manchester works, with production moving to Derby in July 1908, and also, between 1921 and 1926, in Springfield, Massachusetts. Chassis no. 60551, registered AX 201, was the car that was originally given the name "Silver Ghost." Other 40/50 hp cars were also given names, but the Silver Ghost title was taken up by the press, and soon all 40/50s were called by the name, a fact not officially recognised by Rolls-Royce until 1925, when the Phantom range was launched.

					</p>			
			<p>Success with the cars led to the formation of the Rolls-Royce company in March 1906 and to the launch of the six-cylinder Silver Ghost which, within a year, was hailed as 'the best car in the world'.</p>

			<h4 style="margin-bottom:25px">The Rolls-Royce 20/25 built between 1929 and 1936 succeeded the 20 hp as Rolls-Royce's "small car". It was intended to appeal to owner drivers, but many were sold to customers with chauffeurs.

		The late 1920s saw Rolls-Royce develop the 'R' engine to power Britain's entry in the International Schneider Trophy seaplane contest. It established a new world air speed record of over 400mph in 1931.

Subsequently it established new world records on both land and water. More importantly, as subsequent events were to prove, it gave Rolls-Royce the technological base to develop the Merlin, which Royce has begun to work on before his death in 1933.

				<p>
					

The Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud is an automobile produced by Rolls-Royce Limited from April 1955 to March 1966. It was the core model of the Rolls-Royce range during that period. The Silver Cloud replaced the Silver Dawn and was, in turn, replaced by the Silver Shadow. The J. P. Blatchley design was a major change from the pre-war models and the highly derivative Silver Dawn. As part of a range rationalisation the Bentley S1 is very similar, apart from its radiator grille.

				<h1>Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit</h1>
				<img src="assets/silvers_rr.jpg"  style="float: left;width:45%;

				<p>
					The Silver Spirit is a British saloon motor car that was made by Rolls-Royce Motors, in Crewe, England. It was launched in 1980 as the first model in the SZ series.

The Silver Spur is a long-wheelbase version of the Silver Spirit, produced at the same time. The Spirit was the first car to feature the retractable Spirit of Ecstasy. The spring-loaded Mascot sank into the radiator shell if dislodged from its position.
